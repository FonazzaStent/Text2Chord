Text to Chord 1.0.0

The program can convert words and sentences to 4 notes, to form a chord or inspire harmony and melody for
music creation. Have fun turning into music your name, your friends' name, your city name, your favorite
team name, your pet name.
Type or paste text into the text window. Click File-Generate Chord (or Alt-G) to generate the chords.
The program will display on the right side of the textbox three chords of 4 notes generated from three
different algorithms. The notes are not necessarily all different. Sometimes the result will be a chord,
sometimes just two notes or even one, depending on the text you want to convert. The resulting notes can
be used as a starting point to inspire harmony or melody for music creation.
